## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Use a vibrant blue (#29ABE2) to convey trust, reliability, and a modern feel.
- Background color: Light grayish-blue (#F0F8FF) provides a clean, uncluttered backdrop that helps product images and text stand out.
- Accent color: Orange (#FF9933) to highlight interactive elements and calls to action, injecting a sense of energy and excitement.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) will provide a modern, neutral, and readable experience for both headings and body text.
- Use clean, minimalist icons sourced from a consistent library to ensure a cohesive look. Icons should be intuitive and directly related to their actions.
- Employ a grid-based layout for product listings, categories, and the admin dashboard. Prioritize whitespace to avoid visual clutter.
- Implement subtle animations to enhance user interaction, such as a smooth transition for adding items to the cart or loading new products. Use animations sparingly to maintain a polished and professional appearance.
